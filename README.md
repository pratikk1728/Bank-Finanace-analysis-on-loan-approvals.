## 📚 Project Overview

This project analyzes a bank loan dataset to uncover the patterns behind loan approvals.  
I performed data cleaning, handled missing values, explored approval trends, and built visual insights using Python and Power BI.

The goal is to understand **what drives loan approval decisions** — such as credit history, income levels, loan amount, marital status, and property area.
